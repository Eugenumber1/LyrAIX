ain't a dime just a nickel actin' hostile  beyonce headed for the big top and bouncin' off this side show narration beyoncé  i sometimes wish i could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else before i was famous i was the girl on the heel with the  i was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach and now that i'm famous it's really really difficult to do very simple things i think it's the hardest thing to give up but my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim never make excuses never expect anyone else to provide for me things i know i can provide for myself i have dreams and i feel like i have a power to actually make those dreams a reality when you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore you become the property of the public there's nothing real about it  just look at these dazzling women the finest representatives of our nation ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown  you can't put your finger on who i am i can't put my finger on who i am i am complicated i grew up with a lot of conflict and drama's and i've been through a lot just like everyone else my escape was always music and i'm so lucky that that's my job but if i accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with it would be worth nothing you know you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter you have to have something that is forever something that's invisible  i was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable and i always felt like it was my job to fix the problem people pleaser but i'm no longer afraid of conflict and i don't think conflict is a bad thing because i know that when you grow up when you learn a few things  you're no longer afraid of letting go you're no longer afraid of the unknown you're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable and it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say i like that person you know if i hadn't gone through you know some of the painful experiences in my life i would not be me and i feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary i watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective we do not value ourselves enough especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are i've always been very very specific and very choosy very choosy about what i do with my body and who i want to share that with people feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way there's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life i always considered myself a feminist although i was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it when honestly it's very simple it's just when you know a person that believes in equality for men and women men and women balance each other out and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other i have a lot of empathy for men and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created especially for africanamerican men i have the same empathy for women and the pressures we go through the woman has to provide so many things for their children i consider myself a humanist  you know everybody's not good at everything you know it's ok to depend on someone it's actually what we're supposed to do we're supposed to depend on each other and when you find the person that you trust and you love and you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you it is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life happiness comes from you no one else can make you happy you make you happy and one thing that's for sure the love i have for music for my husband for my child is something that will last far beyond my life omg you done lost yo' motherfreakin' mind   you must have lost yo mind you must've just lost yo mind yo mind you must've just lost yo mind yo mind they told me 'bout all the lies the lies i took

the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes but unless women and men both say this is unacceptable things will not change men have to demand that their wives daughters mothers and sisters earn more commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect  humanity requires both men and women and we are equally important and need one another so why are we viewed as less than equal these old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning we have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect so that as they grow up gender equality becomes a natural way of life and we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible  we have a lot of work to do but we can get there if we work together women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters we must demand that we all receive 00 percent of the

you put my love on top   coachella thank you so much i love you there's a moment where things click when i was in the studio i was threading the songs together and ithought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child in my mind we would perform on star search we would win we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time there's no way in the world i would ever imagine losing as a possbility you know i was only 9 years old so at that time you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose it was the best message for me when i put ed macmahon ducing us as the hiphop rapping girls' tyme it clicked something in my mind i feel like something about the aggression of bow down and the attitude of flawless  the reality is sometimes you lose and you're never too good to lose you're never too big to lose you're never too smart to lose it happens and it happens when it needs to happen and you have to embrace those things    i was scrolling through videos about feminism on youtube and i ran across this video of this incredible nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie everything she said is exactly how i feel  my message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection i had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion and at the end of the day when you go through all of these things is it worth it i mean you get this trophy and you're like 'i basically starved i have neglected all of the people that i love i've conformed to what everybody else thinks i should be and i have this trophy what does that mean' the trophy represents all of the sacrafices i made as a kid all of the time that i lost being on the road in the studios as a child and i just wanna throw that shit up i have a lot of awards and i have a lot of these things that i'm amazing and i'm  i worked my ass of i worked harder then probably everybody i know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'mommy' no nothing feels like when i look at my husband in the eyes nothing feels like when i'm respected when i get on the stage and i see i'm changing people's lives those are the things that matter and at this point in my life that's what i'm striving for growth love happiness fun enjoying your life it's short  that's the message beyoncé  neyo  waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting  beyoncé  it's 6 o'clock and seconds feel

like it i'm stepping in hotter this year i'm stepping in hotter this year so don't you fight it so don't you fight it i see music it's more than justwhat i hear when i'm connected to something i immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion a memory from my childhood thoughts about life my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music and i think that's one of the reasons why i wanted to do a visual album i wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head cause it's what makes it mine that vision in my brain is what i want people to experience the first time    i feel like right now people experience music differently i remember seeing thriller on tv with my family it was an event we all sat around the tv and now looking back i'm so lucky i was born around that time i miss thatimmersive experience now people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their ipods  they don't really invest in a full album it's all about the single and the hype there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans i felt like 'i don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out i just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans' i told my team 'i wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time' everyone thought i was crazy but we're actually doing it it's happening    i wanted to make this body of work and i feel like it's something that's lost in pop music i wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album it was important that we made this a movie we made this an experience i wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me i would make my best art and just put it out and that'sthat's why it's out today remember those walls i built well baby they're tumblin' down and they didn't even put

they stop killing us  we don't need sympathy we need everyone to respect our lives  we're going to stand up as a community and fight against anyone who believes that murder or any violent action by those who are sworn to protect us should consistently go unpunished  these robberies of lives make us feel helpless and hopeless but we have to believe that we are fighting for the rights of the next generation for the next young men and women who believe in good  this is a human fight no matter your race gender or sexual orientation this is a fight for anyone who feels marginalized who is struggling for freedom and human rights  this is not a plea to all police officers but toward any human being who fails to value life the war on people of color and all minorities needs to be over  fear is not an excuse hate will not win  we all have the power to channel our anger and frustration into action we must use our voices to contact the politicians and legislators in our districts and demand social and judicial changes  while we pray for the families of alton sterling and philando castile we will also pray for an end to this plague of injustice in our communities  click in to contact the politicians and legislators in your area your voice will be heard  beyoncé verse when you wish upon a star makes no difference who you are anything your heart desires will come to you

levitated into the basement confessed my sins and was baptized in a river got on my knees and said amen and said i mean i whipped my own back and asked for dominion at your feet i threw myself into a volcano i drank the blood and drank the wine i sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for god i crossed myself in thought i saw the devil i grew thickened skin on my feet i bathed in bleach and plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book but still inside me coiled deep was the need to know are you cheating are you cheating on me beyoncé green light  verse beyoncé some see me say i should be trophied 'cause it gets no stronger ladies y'all know yeah girl ya'll know this pimp ish gets no older is that a threat what's another threat yep that's another threat i'm immune you can get
